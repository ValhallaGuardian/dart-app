Framework: React 19 – the latest industry standard, guaranteeing performance and modularity.
Language: TypeScript – strong data typing. Prevents "undefined" type errors and guarantees that data displayed to the player is correct.
Build Tool: Vite – lightning-fast application loading.
Styling: Tailwind CSS (v3.4) – "Mobile First" approach. The application is responsive (RWD) and optimized for touchscreens (large buttons, dark theme that saves battery/eyes).
Communication: Socket.io Client – real-time connection support.
Architecture: PWA (Progressive Web App) – the application can be installed on a phone, runs full-screen (without the browser address bar) and behaves like a native application.
Routing: React Router – navigation handling (Login -> Lobby -> Game -> Profile).
